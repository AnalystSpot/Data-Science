# Prediction using Unsupervised Learning
### Level : Beginner
## Task :
- For the given Iris dataset find the optimum number of clusters.
- Try to form clusters of flowers using petal width and length features. Drop other 2 features for simplicity.
- Find optimum number of custers using Elbow plot

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of 3 species of Iris.

Species : Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. 

4 Features were measured from each sample : 
- sepal length (cm)	
- sepal width (cm)	
- petal length (cm)	
- petal width (cm)

Based on the combination of these 4 features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
